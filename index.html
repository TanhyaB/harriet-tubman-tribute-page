            There are few women in American history more
            inspiring than Harriet Tubman. Born in the early 1820’s in
            the slave state of Maryland, her childhood was unhappy.
            Like most slaves, she was abused, separated from family,
            and her future looked bleak.

            However, her desire for freedom was greater than her despair,
            and then one night in 1849 she had enough and was quoted as saying,
            “we out!” This made it clear that one way or another she was done
            with living as a slave.

            <li>
                <p class="birth"><strong>1819 Birth</strong>
                    -Araminta Ross [Harriet Tubman] was born into slavery in 1819 or 1820, in Dorchester County,
                    Maryland. Given the names of her two parents, both held in slavery, she was of purely African
                    ancestry. </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="birth"><strong>1844 Marriage</strong>
                    -At the age of 25, she married John Tubman, a free African American who did not
                    share her dream. Since she was a slave, she knew there could be a chance that she could
                    be sold and her marriage would be split apart. Harriet dreamed of traveling north. There,
                    she would be free and would not have to worry about having her marriage split up by the
                    slave trade. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="birth"><strong>1849 Escape</strong>
                    -Harriet was given a piece of paper by a white abolitionist neighbor with two names,
                    and told how to find the first house on her path to freedom. At the first house she
                    was put into a wagon, covered with a sack, and driven to her next destination and
                    kind enough to give her directions to safe houses and names of people who would help
                    her cross the Mason-Dixon line.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="birth"><strong>1850 Conductor</strong>
                    -In September of the same year, Harriet was made an official "conductor" of the UGRR.
                    This meant that she knew all the routes to free territory and she had to take an oath
                    of silence so the secret of the Underground Railroad would be kept secret.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="birth"><strong>1851 Canada</strong>
                    -Harriet's third trip was in September 1851. She went to get her husband, John, but he had
                    remarried and did not want to leave. So she went back up North. Harriet went to Garret's
                    house and found there were more runaways (which were referred to as passengers)
                    to rescue than anticipated. That did not stop her though. She gave a baby a sedative so
                    he would not cry and took the passengers into Pennsylvania. The trip was long and cold
                    but they did reach the safe house of Frederick Douglas.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="birth"><strong>1857 Auburn</strong>
                    -On the road between Syracuse and Rochester, were a number of sympathetic Quakers and other
                    abolitionists settled at Auburn. Here also was the home of US Senator and former New
                    York State Governor William H. Seward (and known for Seward's folly). Sometime in the
                    mid-1850s, Tubman met Seward and his wife Frances. Mrs. Seward provided a home for
                    Tubman's favorite niece, Margaret, after Tubman helped her to escape from Maryland.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="birth"><strong>1861 Civil War</strong>
                    -Tubman returned to the U.S. from living in Canada in 1861. The Civil War had begun and was
                    enlisting all men as soldiers and any women who wanted to join as cooks and nurses.
                    Tubman enlisted into the Union army as a "contraband" nurse in a hospital in Hilton Head,
                    South Carolina and for a time serving at Fortress Monroe, where Jefferson Davis would
                    later be imprisoned.. Contrabands were blacks who the Union army helped to escape from
                    the Southern compounds.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="birth"><strong>1869 Second Marriage</strong>
                    -After the war, Harriet returned home to Auburn. In 1869, she married Nelson Davis and
                    together they shared a calm, peaceful 19 year marriage until he died.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="birth"><strong>1913 Death</strong>
                    -Before she died on March 10, 1913, she gave her home for the elderly to the
                    Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Tubman was buried with military rites in Fort Hill
                    Cemetery, a short drive from the home. A year after her death, Auburn declared a
                    one-day memorial to its anti-slavery hero. Residents of the city that day unveiled
                    the Harriet Tubman Plaque, which remains on display at the entrance of the Cayuga County
                    Court House. She has since received man honors, including the naming of the Liberty
                    Ship Harriet Tubman, christened in 1944 by Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>

                “What we think we know about Tubman really only consists of a decade of her life,” said Erica Armstrong
                Dunbar, author of the new biography She Came to Slay.
